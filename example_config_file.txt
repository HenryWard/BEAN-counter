# Removing conditions tagged with bad/suspicious index tags. Select from the following options:
# 0) Type "0" if no index tags should be removed
# 1) Type "1" if pre-defined index tags should be removed (in the data/index_tags/index_tags_to_remove.txt file)
#    (This is best for small screens)
# 2) Type "2" if badly behaving index tags should be discovered from the data and removed,
#    based on the correlations of control conditions possessing the same index tag. The
#    correlation cutoff for removal is specified in the "index_tag_correlation_cutoff"
#    parameter below (this is best for larger screens)
# 3) Type "3" if procedures for both "1" and "2" should be performed.
