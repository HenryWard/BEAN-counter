# This file contains relevant information for any species interrogated
# in chemical genomic screens. Information includes the sequence coordinates
# of the common primer, index tag, and genetic barcode, as well as the
# names of the species-specific functional information files.

# The format is as follows:
# species_ID:
# gene_barcode_file: filename within barseq_counter_vX.Y/data/barcodes
# common_primer_start:
# common_primer_length:
# common_primer_sequence:
# index_tag_start:
# index_tag_length:
# genetic_barcode_start:
# genetic_barcode_length:
# gene_info_file: (possibly optional, not sure yet) filename within barseq_counter_vX.Y/data/gene_info
# --- (use '---' to separate different species)
